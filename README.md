# Terraria-Mod-Creator
[> Main Downlead Page <](https://crawdad105.itch.io/tmc)
Coding can be boaring but what if it wasint, well i dont think i solved that but this program can help you create mods for TML.
TMC also known as terraria mod creator was a project of mine that i started a long time ago but never go around to it. 
This repository means nothing to me because the code in it is a peace of trash, its only here to say i have open sourced it.

Feel free to do anything with this program, mabye it will help, but i doubt it.

# What can it do?
you can create item and recipies however you do need prior modding knoladg on where to palce these files.

# Future plan
my future plan for this is that it can help you create full mods without the burden of coding anything. 
although for this goal it dose reqire me to compleatly remake everything because the current code is all over the place, slow and messy and bad and not good.
